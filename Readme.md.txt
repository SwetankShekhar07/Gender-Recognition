# Gender Classification Model

This project involves a pre-trained gender classification model that predicts the gender of a person in an image. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.12
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Model and Image Files

Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
- `model.h5`: The pre-trained model file.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwetankShekhar07/Gender-Recognition
cd Gender-Recognition
```

2. **Update the Python script with the path to your model and image files.**

3. **Run the Python script to load the model, preprocess the image, make a prediction, and display the result.**

## Example

If your model file is named `model.h5`
